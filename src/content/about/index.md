I'm a software developer that enjoys breaking down difficult issues into smaller solutions. I create scalable backend apps using cutting-edge technology and security in mind.

I am currently in my final year undergraduate studies from [Lovely Professional University](https://www.lpu.in/) pursuing a bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the year 2019-2023. I have been among the team of brilliant engineers building things for the world. And I am also currently the Tech Lead at [Google Developer Student Club](https://gdsc.community.dev/lovely-professional-university-jalandhar/).
