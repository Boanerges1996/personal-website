I'm a software developer that enjoys breaking down difficult issues into smaller solutions. I create scalable fullstack apps using cutting-edge technology and security in mind.

I recently graduated from [Lovely Professional University](https://www.lpu.in/) pursuing a bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the year 2019-2023. I have been among the team of brilliant engineers building things for the world. And I was formally the Tech Lead at [Google Developer Student Club LPU](https://gdsc.community.dev/lovely-professional-university-jalandhar/). I am currently I Fullstack Software Engineer @ [WebRTC.Ventures](https://webrtc.ventures)
